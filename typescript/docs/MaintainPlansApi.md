# **refund**

#### **POST** /api/installmentplans/{installmentPlanNumber}/refund

### Description
Refund part or all of an installment Plan.

### Strategies

There are several refund strategies you can choose when refunding a plan (note that the default is `FutureInstallmentsFirst`):

* `FutureInstallmentsFirst`: At first customer isnâ€™t refunded any installment money that they have already paid. Instead their refund lessens the amount of future installments they will be debited for, beginning with the next installment that is due. However, if their refund exceeds the amount of money they have left to pay (all installments), only then is the refund taken out of the installment money they have already paid
* `FutureInstallmentsLast`: Customer is refunded beginning with the installment money they have already paid. If their refund amount exceeds the amount they have already paid, their amount of future installments due gets decreased, beginning with the next installment due and then proceeding to the later ones
* `FutureInstallmentsNotAllowed`: Customer is only refunded from installment money that they have already paid, not from any future installments that they have due
* `ReduceFromLastInstallment`: This is the same as `FutureInstallmentsFirst`, except that the refund is credited starting with the last installment first (e.g., number 6 of 6, as opposed to number 2 of 6).


### Example


```typescript
import { Splitit } from "splitit-web-typescript-sdk";

const splitit = new Splitit({
  // Defining the base path is optional and defaults to https://web-api-v3.production.splitit.com
  // basePath: "https://web-api-v3.production.splitit.com",
  oauthClientId: "CLIENT_ID",
