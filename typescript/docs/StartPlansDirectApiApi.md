Method | HTTP request | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
[**checkEligibility**](StartPlansDirectApiApi.md#checkEligibility) | **POST** /api/installmentplans/check-eligibility | Check Eligibility
[**post2**](StartPlansDirectApiApi.md#post2) | **POST** /api/installmentplans | Create Installment Plan


# **checkEligibility**

#### **POST** /api/installmentplans/check-eligibility

### Description
As your customer begins to checkout, use this endpoint to verify their overall eligibility for Splitit
installment plans and to determine plans for which they are eligible.
This endpoint can be called repeatedly before and during checkout, for example you may
call it after each field on a page is filled out. The Splitit API compares and updates the plan
based on each new body as it arrives.


### Example


```typescript
import { Splitit } from "splitit-web-typescript-sdk";

const splitit = new Splitit({
  // Defining the base path is optional and defaults to https://web-api-v3.production.splitit.com
  // basePath: "https://web-api-v3.production.splitit.com",
  oauthClientId: "CLIENT_ID",
  oauthClientSecret: "CLIENT_SECRET",
});

const checkEligibilityResponse =
  await splitit.startPlansDirectApi.checkEligibility({
    xSplititIdempotencyKey: "xSplititIdempotencyKey_example",
    xSplititTouchPoint: "",
  });

console.log(checkEligibilityResponse);

# **post2**

#### **POST** /api/installmentplans

### Description
Once you are ready to check your customer out, you can use the `Create` endpoint.
`Create` enables you to pass in PCI sensitive data directly to the Splitit API,
and thus requires SAQ-D PCI certification.

A successful `Create` operation creates an authorization on a customer's credit
card, and if `AutoCapture` has been set to `true` within the request body, both
authorization and capture of the first installment will be completed (if `AutoCapture` is set to false, you will
have to call [Update Plan](/api-v3/update-plan-by-number) later). If Splitit is unable
to successfully secure an authorization on
a credit card, an error message will be returned in the response. Note that for funded
plans, a customer's `BillingAddress` object must be filled out.
In addition, if you are completely managing the input of PCI sensitive data on
your side, itâ€™s essential to ensure your customer has approved the Splitit
specific terms and conditions.


### Example


```typescript
import { Splitit } from "splitit-web-typescript-sdk";

const splitit = new Splitit({
  // Defining the base path is optional and defaults to https://web-api-v3.production.splitit.com
  // basePath: "https://web-api-v3.production.splitit.com",
  oauthClientId: "CLIENT_ID",
  oauthClientSecret: "CLIENT_SECRET",
});

const post2Response = await splitit.startPlansDirectApi.post2({
  xSplititTestMode: "None",
  xSplititIdempotencyKey: "xSplititIdempotencyKey_example",
  xSplititTouchPoint: "",
  AutoCapture: true,
  TermsAndConditionsAccepted: true,
});

console.log(post2Response);
```
